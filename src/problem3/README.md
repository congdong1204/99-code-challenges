# React Wallet Component - Code Review & Improvements

## Issues Found

### Critical Bugs

- `lhsPriority` undefined variable (should be `balancePriority`)
- Missing `blockchain` property in `WalletBalance` interface
- Incomplete sort function (missing `return 0` case)

### Performance Issues

- Multiple `getPriority` calls for same blockchain
- `getPriority` function recreated on every render
- Wrong `useMemo` dependencies (`prices` included but not used)
- Separate filter/sort/format operations instead of combined

### Anti-patterns

- Using `key={index}` in React lists
- `any` type for blockchain parameter
- Unused `formattedBalances` variable
- Incorrect filter logic keeping zero/negative balances

## Key Improvements

### 1. Bug Fixes

- Fixed undefined variable and missing interface property
- Corrected filter logic to only keep positive balances
- Added missing equality case in sort function

### 2. Performance Optimizations

- Combined filter/sort/map in single `useMemo`
- Memoized `getPriority` with `useCallback`
- Fixed `useMemo` dependencies
- Memoized `rows` to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### 3. Type Safety

- Added proper TypeScript interfaces and union types
- Removed `any` types
- Strong typing for all functions and data

### 4. React Best Practices

- Used unique keys instead of index
- Proper memoization patterns
- Clean component structure

## Benefits

- **Performance**: Fewer re-renders and function calls
- **Maintainability**: Better code organization and typing
- **Reliability**: Fixed bugs and logical errors
- **React Compliance**: Following established patterns
